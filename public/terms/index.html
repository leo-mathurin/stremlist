                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>Welcome to Stremlist ("Service"), a personal project that creates a connection between public IMDb watchlists and the Stremio streaming platform. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
                <p>Stremlist is a free addon for Stremio that allows users to access their public IMDb watchlists directly within the Stremio application. The Service processes publicly available IMDb watchlist data and formats it for Stremio without storing any personal data.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Use of the Service</h3>
                <p>You may use this Service only if you have a public IMDb watchlist and agree to provide your public IMDb user ID. The Service only accesses publicly available data that you have explicitly made public through IMDb's platform.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Limitations</h3>
                <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind. The Service developer is not responsible for any issues related to IMDb or Stremio functionality or any content accessed through these platforms.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>Stremlist interacts with third-party services (IMDb and Stremio). Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms and conditions and privacy policies. Stremlist is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by IMDb or Stremio.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Modifications to Service</h3>
                <p>The Service developer reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service with or without notice.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Contact</h3>

                <h3>1. Information Collection</h3>
                <p>Stremlist does not collect or store any personal information from its users except the IMDb user ID that you explicitly provide to use the Service. This ID is only used to fetch your public IMDb watchlist data.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Use of Information</h3>
                <p>The IMDb user ID you provide is used solely to retrieve your public watchlist data from IMDb and convert it into a format usable by Stremio. Your ID is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with any third parties.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Data Storage</h3>
                <p>Stremlist caches your IMDb watchlist data in a database to improve performance. However, this cached data is regularly overridden by the sync system, ensuring that your watchlist is always up-to-date. No permanent user profiles or personal information beyond your public IMDb user ID is stored.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Cookies and Tracking</h3>
                <p>The Stremlist website does not use cookies or any tracking technologies to collect user information.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Email Communications</h3>
                <p>Stremlist does not send emails to users. The only email communications are system notifications sent to the administrator's email address regarding system operations and deployment status.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>Stremlist interacts with IMDb to access your public watchlist data. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of IMDb. We encourage you to review IMDb's privacy policy.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Data Security</h3>
                <p>While we implement reasonable security measures, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your information.</p>
                
                <h3>8. Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
                
                <h3>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
